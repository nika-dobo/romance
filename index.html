                            <p>Giorgi and Nini were two complete strangers. They met at one of the Georgian online
                                hackathons, where everyone was randomly paired up. Giorgi was good at programming, and
                                Nini
                                had an amazing sense of design. At first, they focused only on the project ‚Äî a
                                registration
                                page, an attractive homepage, and a little JavaScript.

                                But as the nights passed, the dialogue between them became more than just technical.
                                Nini
                                once said cheerfully: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs love in your code,‚Äù and Giorgi replied: ‚ÄúYou give your
                                design
                                soul.‚Äù

                                They worked together all week ‚Äî Zoom sessions, shared screens, randomly sent smileys,
                                and
                                music they listened to together in the background.

                                The project was a success. They took second place in the hackathon, but for them, the
                                first
                                thing they had to do was start something. When they finally met in person, Nini smiled
                                quietly and said: ‚ÄúYou know, you were my best project.‚Äù

                                They still work together today ‚Äì one writes code, the other draws the world. They say
                                love
                                comes when you least expect it ‚Äì sometimes when you think you're just building a
                                website.

                            <h1>Letters left in the past </h1>
                            <p>Ani and Luka were childhood friends. They lived next door and left letters in
                                each other‚Äôs mailboxes every day ‚Äî drawings, heartfelt phrases, and even little
                                secrets. Years passed, life moved on, and Ani moved to another city, while Luka
                                stayed in the old neighborhood.

                                One night, Ani decided to return to the house of the past. Now someone new had
                                moved in next door to the old house, but she found a strange little envelope in
                                her mailbox. Inside was a letter ‚Äî a letter written to Ani that Luka had written
                                as a child but never sent.

                                ‚ÄúIf you ever come back and find this, I want you to know that everything has
                                changed since you left. Childhood ended for me with your eyes.‚Äù

                                Ani couldn‚Äôt believe that she had found the letter now ‚Äî years later. She found
                                Luka on social media. She sent him a photo of the letter. The answer was not
                                long in coming:

                                ‚ÄúYou know, I didn‚Äôt have the courage to look for you at that time. But now I
                                hope that we can write everything from scratch‚Ä¶ like in a new letter.‚Äù

                                Today they are writing a new story together. No longer on paper, but in real
                                life ‚Äî where childhood memories have turned into love.

                                Tamar first met Nika on Zoom for a school project. They had a strange conversation ‚Äî
                                neither of them wanted to turn on the camera, but in the end they both pressed the
                                button at the same time. That's when they saw each other for the first time.

                                At first, it was just teamwork. The project was about technology, but the conversation
                                between them turned to something completely different ‚Äî plans for the future, music,
                                childhood dreams. They would meet each other late every evening via video call.

                                Tamar says that the sound of Nika's laughter is especially memorable to her. Nika
                                remembers how Tamar once said to her: ‚ÄúI didn't think I would feel so close to someone
                                on a digital screen.‚Äù

                                The project ended. The meetings seemed to be no longer necessary, but they still
                                continued to call. Sometimes, there was no need for sound ‚Äî they just looked at each
                                other on the turned-on camera and listened to the music.

                                One day, Nika held up a small card to the screen that read: ‚ÄúPlease come meet me in the
                                real world.‚Äù

                                Tamar smiled quietly and for the first time said the words that had been written behind
                                the screen for a long time: ‚ÄúI wanted that too.‚Äù

                                Even today, their home still has the laptop on which they first made love ‚Äî after a
                                video call.

                            <h1>Just one comment </h1>
                            <p>Elene never thought that a comment left on YouTube would change the course of her life.
                                One video ‚Äî with old romantic melodies ‚Äî had such an impact that she simply wrote: ‚ÄúThis
                                song touches a part of my soul.‚Äù

                                Within hours, she received a reply from a stranger:
                                ‚ÄúMe too. It felt like it entered my heart with sadness but warmth.‚Äù

                                Their dialogue continued in the comments. Then they moved to Instagram, where they
                                shared their favorite songs with each other. Their conversations about music turned into
                                conversations about childhood, fears, and dreams.

                                For months, Elene and Data communicated only through text.

                                Data often wrote: ‚ÄúI prefer your voice to music as much as I prefer notes to melody.‚Äù

                                One day, Data sent Elene an audio message. Her voice touched Elene‚Äôs heart ‚Äî warmth and
                                sincerity resonated in every word.

                                A few weeks later, they met for the first time. Data gave Elene a small cassette tape
                                containing a composition he had recorded for her ‚Äì beginning with the words of their
                                first dialogue:
                                ‚ÄúThis song touches a point in my soul.‚Äù

                                Sometimes love begins with just one comment. And it becomes a melody that plays in your
                                mind for the rest of your life.

                                She replied:
                                ‚ÄúI think you got the wrong number.‚Äù

                                But the stranger, Saba, laughed back:
                                ‚ÄúIf we started like this, maybe I shouldn‚Äôt rush to leave?‚Äù

                                Mariam found this answer oddly sincere. You wouldn‚Äôt think that a conversation with a
                                complete stranger would start so naturally, but it did. Nothing much came of their
                                conversation that day, but the next day Saba wrote to her again. And then again.

                                They never left each other. The topics went from the simple to the deep. Once Saba
                                wrote:
                                ‚ÄúSometimes I think that a random emoji sent is the most correct path I‚Äôve ever taken.‚Äù

                                Finally, they planned to meet. Both of them were afraid ‚Äî maybe this whole connection
                                was only real behind the screen? But when they met, when they looked into each other‚Äôs
                                eyes, everything became clear‚Äînothing had changed.

                                Saba put a small card in Mariam‚Äôs hand that read:
                                ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt mistaken about your number‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt mistaken about you.‚Äù

                                Mariam laughs as she tells it. She says, ‚ÄúSometimes the right message in life comes
                                right when you think someone has messed you up.‚Äù

                            <p> Levan had loved programming since childhood, but he was often afraid of real-life
                                relationships. He met Nini at school ‚Äî a girl who was always drawing on paper. Not a
                                single word was superfluous, she just silently watched Levan as he sat at his laptop.

                                One day, Nini dared to give Levan a small sketch. There, along with their names, a small
                                app logo was drawn. Below it was written:
                                ‚ÄúLove like code ‚Äî with your mind and heart.‚Äù

                                Levan immediately understood ‚Äî this was an invitation, not just to a relationship, but
                                to a new project. In a few months, he created a small app called ‚ÄúNino‚Äù ‚Äî a digital
                                diary that allowed a person to record one important emotion every day.

                                The app‚Äôs logo featured the very sketch that Nini had given him.

                                When the app gained some popularity, Levan said at the official presentation:
                                ‚ÄúThis is not just code, this is code written with love.‚Äù

                                Today, Nini and Levan are working together on a new version called "We".
